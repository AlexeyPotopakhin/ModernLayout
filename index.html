                <p class="descriptionText">
                    The Xperia Z3+ continues the Sony design story with a sleek rounded aluminium frame,
                    durable tempered glass panels and a uniquely designed power button. At just 6.9 mm and 144 grams,
                    the Xperia Z3+ design is slimmer and lighter than ever – and incredibly comfortable to hold.
                    Choose from four sophisticated colours to match your taste and your lifestyle.
                    The Sony Xperia Z3+ has an impressive IP65/IP68 rating,
                    which makes this dual SIM smartphone both waterproof* and resistant to the tiniest dust particles.
                    It can easily handle being dipped in the sink.
                    In fact, if it gets dirty you can simply rinse it off under the tap.
                    And because the USB port is now capless, you can splash away without worrying about
                    having to close it.
                    Whether you’re shooting a skyline at night, or using your front camera to capture your look,
                    your photos should do the moment justice. The Xperia Z3+ is the smartphone that brings
                    innovative Sony camera technologies to both rear and front cameras.
                    For crisp photos however you shoot.
                    With PS4™ Remote Play you can seamlessly switch from your PS4 console to your smartphone
                    ─ and take your gaming to another room.

                    With Sony’s passion for perfection, this waterproof smartphone blends design
                    and engineering to deliver beauty that lasts. Its super-slim, rounded aluminium frame,
                    uniquely-designed power button and durable tempered glass panels, give it an elegant,
                    premium finish. And with an easy-to-use interface and symmetrical
                    design it feels right at home in your hand.
                    With the waterproof Xperia Z3, you can take pictures with the best smartphone
                    camera while swimming in fresh water for up to 30 minutes.
                    You can even dive down to 1.5 metres with it. Just remember that all the covers
                    for the micro USB port, the micro SIM slot and the memory card slot
                    must be firmly closed. With Xperia Z3 we bring our renowned Handycam recording
                    technology to a waterproof smartphone. Shoot your most important moments in
                    stunning 4K resolution, and edit your creations directly on your phone. Because we
                    know that filming with a smartphone can sometimes lead to jerky footage,
                    we’ve developed our SteadyShot™ technology. Now better than ever with
                    Intelligent Active Mode™*, it estimates movements and analyses dozens of frames,
                    for smoother and more stable videos.
